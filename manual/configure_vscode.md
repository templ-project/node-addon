# Configuring Visual Studio Code for developing a NodeJs C++ Addon  

> [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is one of the most popular free IDEs in the market at the current time, with thousands and thousands of extensions. What the IDE lacks, you can always search for and write your own extension.
> 
> In addition, the [ITMCDev C/C++ Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=itmcdev.node-cpp-extension-pack) I composed throughout time, helps me write and develop C/C++ applications with a lot of ease.

## Configuration for C++

Visual Studio Code is gifted with two plugins for C/C++ support:
  - Microsoft C/C++ [ms-vscode.cpptools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) with good support for language support, debugging and intellisense, yet no formatting options and
  - LLVM Clangd [llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd) with pretty much everything that Microsoft does but better + adding formatting options.

> In the [C/C++ Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=itmcdev.generic-cpp-pack) I have presented above, both `ms-vscode.cpptools` and `llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd` are included and it will be up to you which one you wish to use. 
>
> My persoanl preference is `llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd`.

In order to configure the template for usage with VSCode, please use the following command:

```bash
node .scripts/configure.js -e vscode <...other arguments>
```

If you are using the [ITMCDev C/C++ Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=itmcdev.generic-cpp-pack)

Make sure to either disable [ms-vscode.cpptools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) or [llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd) (but not both) to remove any possible conflict while running the IDE. 

Also, if you're using the CLang one, make sure to follow its instructions to setup CLangd binary.

## Configuration templates & files

### .vscode/c_cpp_properties.json

This file is [provided VSCode with a way of configuring the C/C++ interpreter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/c-cpp-properties-schema-reference) and is generated by the [c_cpp_properties.json.js](../.scripts/configure/c_cpp_properties.json.js) through the `configure.js` script.

> Do not modify the `.json` file as it is overwritten by `pre-commit` hook. Always alter the `.json.js` one, and then run the `configure.js` script again.

For a better understanding of this file, please read [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/c-cpp-properties-schema-reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/c-cpp-properties-schema-reference)


### .vscode/launch.json

For a better understanding of this file, please read [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) section in the Visual Studio Code documentation.

This file is generated by the [launch.json.twig](../.scripts/configure/launch.json.twig) through the `configure.js` script.

> Do not modify the `.json` file as it is overwritten by `pre-commit` hook. Always alter the `.twig` file, and then run the `configure.js` script again.

### .vscode/settings.json


`settings.json` is file offers developers a way to overwrite VSCode settings based on the project they are working with. I chose to alter this file through [settings.json.js](../.scripts/configure/settings.json.js) to disable/enable the [ms-vscode.cpptools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) module, based on the `configure.js` run options.
